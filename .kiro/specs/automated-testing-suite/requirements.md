# Automated Testing Suite Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a comprehensive automated testing suite for the DupFinder application. The testing suite will provide multi-layered testing coverage including unit tests, integration tests, UI tests, end-to-end tests, performance tests, and accessibility tests.

## Glossary

- **Testing Suite**: The complete collection of automated tests and testing infrastructure
- **UI Test Framework**: Custom framework for automated user interface testing
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Automated comparison of UI screenshots against baselines
- **E2E Tests**: End-to-end tests that validate complete user workflows
- **Test Harness**: Infrastructure that manages test execution and reporting
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment automated testing
- **Test Coverage**: Measurement of code and functionality covered by tests
- **Performance Baseline**: Reference measurements for performance comparison
