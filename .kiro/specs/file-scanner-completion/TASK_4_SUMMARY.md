# Task 4 Implementation Summary: Scan Statistics and Reporting

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive scan statistics and reporting functionality for the FileScanner component.

## Changes Made

### 1. Header File (include/file_scanner.h)

#### Added ScanStatistics Structure
```cpp
struct ScanStatistics {
    int totalFilesScanned = 0;          // Total files found and processed
    int totalDirectoriesScanned = 0;    // Total directories traversed
    qint64 totalBytesScanned = 0;       // Total bytes in scanned files
    int filesFilteredBySize = 0;        // Files excluded by size constraints
    int filesFilteredByPattern = 0;     // Files excluded by pattern matching
    int filesFilteredByHidden = 0;      // Files excluded because they're hidden
    int directoriesSkipped = 0;         // Directories skipped (system dirs, hidden, etc.)
    int errorsEncountered = 0;          // Total errors during scan
    qint64 scanDurationMs = 0;          // Scan duration in milliseconds
    double filesPerSecond = 0.0;        // Scan rate (files/second)
    qint64 peakMemoryUsage = 0;         // Peak memory usage (if available)
};
```

#### Added Public Methods
- `ScanStatistics getScanStatistics() const` - Retrieve current statistics

#### Added Signals
- `void scanStatistics(const ScanStatistics& statistics)` - Emitted when scan completes with full statistics

#### Added Member Variables
- `mutable ScanStatistics m_statistics` - Statistics accumulator (mutable for const methods)
- `QDateTime m_scanStartTime` - Scan start timestamp
- `QDateTime m_scanEndTime` - Scan end timestamp

### 2. Implementation File (src/core/file_scanner.cpp)

#### Modified startScan()
- Initialize statistics structure to zero
- Record scan start time

#### Modified processScanQueue()
- Record scan end time when scan completes
- Calculate scan duration in milliseconds
- Calculate files per second rate
- Emit scanStatistics signal with complete statistics
- Log statistics summary to debug output

#### Modified shouldIncludeFile()
- Track files filtered by size (`filesFilteredBySize++`)
- Track files filtered by hidden status (`filesFilteredByHidden++`)
- Track files filtered by pattern matching (`filesFilteredByPattern++`)

#### Modified shouldScanDirectory()
- Track directories skipped (`directoriesSkipped++`)

#### Modified scanDirectory()
- Track directories scanned (`totalDirectoriesScanned++`)

#### Added getScanStatistics()
- Returns current statistics structure

### 3. Test File (tests/unit/main_test.cpp)

Added 9 comprehensive test cases:

1. **testBasicStatistics()** - Verifies all basic statistics are collected
2. **testStatisticsSignal()** - Verifies statistics signal is emitted
3. **testFilesFilteredBySize()** - Verifies size filtering is tracked
4. **testFilesFilteredByPattern()** - Verifies pattern filtering is tracked
5. **testFilesFilteredByHidden()** - Verifies hidden file filtering is tracked
6. **testDirectoriesScanned()** - Verifies directory count is tracked
7. **testScanDuration()** - Verifies scan duration is calculated
8. **testFilesPerSecond()** - Verifies scan rate calculation is correct
9. **testErrorsInStatistics()** - Verifies errors are included in statistics

## Test Results

All 28 unit tests pass successfully:
```
Totals: 28 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 blacklisted, 3283ms
```

Statistics tests specifically:
- ✅ testBasicStatistics
- ✅ testStatisticsSignal
- ✅ testFilesFilteredBySize
- ✅ testFilesFilteredByPattern
- ✅ testFilesFilteredByHidden
- ✅ testDirectoriesScanned
- ✅ testScanDuration
- ✅ testFilesPerSecond
- ✅ testErrorsInStatistics

## Example Output

```
FileScanner: Statistics - Files: 15 Directories: 1 Bytes: 397 Duration: 11 ms Rate: 1363.64 files/sec

testBasicStatistics:
  Files scanned: 15
  Directories scanned: 1
  Bytes scanned: 397
  Duration: 11 ms
  Files/sec: 1363.64
```

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 2.6**: Error summary statistics
- Tracks total errors encountered
- Includes error count in statistics structure

✅ **Requirement 3.6**: Performance metrics
- Tracks scan duration in milliseconds
- Calculates files per second rate
- Tracks total bytes scanned
- Provides comprehensive performance data

## Features Implemented

1. **Comprehensive Statistics Collection**
   - Total files and directories scanned
   - Total bytes processed
   - Detailed filtering breakdowns (size, pattern, hidden)
   - Error tracking
   - Performance metrics

2. **Automatic Calculation**
   - Scan duration computed from start/end timestamps
   - Files per second rate automatically calculated
   - All statistics updated in real-time during scan

3. **Signal-Based Reporting**
   - Statistics emitted via signal when scan completes
   - Allows UI components to display statistics
   - Non-blocking, event-driven architecture

4. **Getter Method**
   - `getScanStatistics()` allows querying statistics at any time
   - Useful for progress monitoring or post-scan analysis

## Integration Points

The statistics feature integrates seamlessly with:
- Error handling system (tracks error counts)
- Pattern matching system (tracks pattern-filtered files)
- Size filtering (tracks size-filtered files)
- Progress reporting (provides performance metrics)

## Performance Impact

Minimal performance impact:
- Statistics tracking uses simple integer increments
- No additional I/O operations
- Timestamp recording only at start/end
- Calculation performed once at completion

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future tasks:
- Peak memory usage tracking (currently placeholder)
- Per-directory statistics breakdown
- Real-time statistics updates during scan
- Statistics export to JSON/CSV
- Historical statistics comparison

## Conclusion

Task 4 has been successfully completed with full test coverage and comprehensive statistics tracking. The implementation provides valuable insights into scan performance and filtering behavior, meeting all specified requirements.
