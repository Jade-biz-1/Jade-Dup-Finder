# Task 6 Summary: Integration Testing with DuplicateDetector

## Task Overview
Implemented comprehensive integration tests for FileScanner and DuplicateDetector components to verify their compatibility and end-to-end workflow.

## Implementation Details

### Test File Created
- **File**: `tests/integration/test_filescanner_duplicatedetector.cpp`
- **Lines of Code**: ~700 lines
- **Test Framework**: Qt Test

### Test Cases Implemented

#### 1. FileInfo Structure Compatibility
- **Purpose**: Verify that FileScanner::FileInfo and DuplicateDetector::FileInfo are compatible
- **Coverage**: Tests all fields (filePath, fileSize, fileName, directory, lastModified)
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

#### 2. FileInfo::fromScannerInfo() Conversion
- **Purpose**: Verify the conversion function works correctly
- **Coverage**: Tests conversion of multiple files with field-by-field validation
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

#### 3. End-to-End Duplicate Detection Workflow
- **Purpose**: Complete workflow from scan to duplicate detection
- **Test Data**: 
  - 3 duplicate sets (3, 4, 2 files each)
  - 2 unique files
  - Total: 11 files
- **Phases Tested**:
  1. File scanning with FileScanner
  2. Duplicate detection with DuplicateDetector
  3. Results verification
- **Verification**:
  - Duplicate groups found correctly
  - File counts match expected values
  - Wasted space calculated correctly
  - Hash values are valid SHA-256
  - Recommendations generated
  - Statistics accurate
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

#### 4. Large Dataset Performance (10,000+ files)
- **Purpose**: Test with large number of files to verify performance
- **Test Data**:
  - Total files: 10,000
  - Duplicate sets: 100 (10 files each)
  - Unique files: 9,000
- **Performance Metrics Measured**:
  - Scan time and rate
  - Detection time
  - Overall throughput
  - Memory usage (indirectly)
- **Performance Results**:
  - Scan completed successfully
  - Detection completed successfully
  - All duplicate groups found
  - Performance targets met (scan rate > 16.67 files/sec)
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

#### 5. Signal/Slot Connections and Error Handling
- **Purpose**: Verify all signals work correctly and errors are handled
- **Signals Tested**:
  - `detectionStarted`
  - `detectionProgress`
  - `duplicateGroupFound`
  - `detectionCompleted`
  - `detectionError`
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

#### 6. Cancellation Support
- **Purpose**: Verify cancellation works correctly
- **Coverage**: Tests cancellation during detection process
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

#### 7. Different Detection Levels
- **Purpose**: Test Quick, Standard, and Deep detection levels
- **Levels Tested**:
  - Quick (size-based only)
  - Standard (size + hash)
- **Verification**:
  - Quick mode uses "(size-based)" as hash
  - Standard mode calculates actual SHA-256 hashes
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

### Build Configuration
- Updated `tests/CMakeLists.txt` to include new test executable
- Added test to CTest with appropriate timeout (300 seconds)
- Added labels: "integration;standalone;filescanner;duplicatedetector"

## Test Results

### Summary
