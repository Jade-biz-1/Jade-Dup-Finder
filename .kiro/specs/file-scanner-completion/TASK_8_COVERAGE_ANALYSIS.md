## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Write Missing Tests (2 hours)
1. Create test_file_scanner_coverage.cpp
2. Implement high-priority tests (1-4)
3. Implement medium-priority tests (5-8)
4. Implement low-priority tests (9-10)

### Phase 2: Run Tests and Measure Coverage (30 minutes)
1. Build with coverage enabled
2. Run all tests
3. Generate coverage report with lcov
4. Verify 90%+ coverage achieved

### Phase 3: Document Intentionally Untested Code (30 minutes)
1. Identify any code that cannot be tested
2. Document reasons (e.g., platform-specific, requires special hardware)
3. Add comments in source code

## Intentionally Untested Code

### Platform-Specific Code
- None identified (all code is cross-platform)

### Code Requiring Special Setup
1. **Network timeout simulation**
   - Requires network drive or mock
   - Difficult to test reliably in unit tests
   - Covered by integration tests instead

2. **Actual permission denied scenarios**
   - Requires root/admin privileges to set up
   - Tested with best-effort approach (e.g., /root/.ssh)

### Trivial Getters/Setters
- All getters are tested through usage in other tests
- No complex logic in getters

## Coverage Target Achievement

**Target:** 90%+ code coverage for FileScanner

**Current Estimate:** 75%

**Gap:** 15%

**Tests Needed:** 10 additional tests

**Estimated Time:** 3 hours total
- Writing tests: 2 hours
- Running and verifying: 30 minutes
- Documentation: 30 minutes

## Success Criteria

✅ All critical uncovered paths have tests  
✅ Coverage report shows 90%+ line coverage  
✅ Coverage report shows 85%+ branch coverage  
✅ All tests pass  
✅ Intentionally untested code is documented  

## Notes

- Some code paths (like network timeouts) are difficult to test in unit tests
- Integration tests provide additional coverage for complex scenarios
- Focus on testing business logic and error handling
- Performance tests cover optimization code paths
