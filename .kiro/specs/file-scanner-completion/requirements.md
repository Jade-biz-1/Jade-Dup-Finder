# Requirements Document: FileScanner Completion

## Introduction

This spec covers the completion of the FileScanner component to bring it to production-ready status. The FileScanner is currently 70% complete with basic functionality working. This phase will add pattern matching, enhanced error handling, and performance optimizations to complete Phase 1.1.1 of the implementation plan.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Pattern-Based File Filtering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to include or exclude files based on patterns (like *.jpg or *.tmp), so that I can focus my scans on specific file types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides glob patterns (*.jpg, *.png) THEN the system SHALL match files using those patterns
2. WHEN a user provides regex patterns THEN the system SHALL support proper regex matching with escaping
3. WHEN include patterns are specified THEN the system SHALL only include matching files
4. WHEN exclude patterns are specified THEN the system SHALL exclude matching files
5. WHEN pattern matching is configured THEN the system SHALL support case-insensitive matching by default with option for case-sensitive
6. WHEN invalid patterns are provided THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and log warnings

### Requirement 2: Robust Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scanner to handle errors gracefully (like permission denied or network timeouts), so that my scan can continue even when some files are inaccessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a permission denied error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue scanning other files
2. WHEN a file system error occurs THEN the system SHALL emit specific error signals with error codes and descriptions
3. WHEN a network drive timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL handle the timeout and continue with other directories
4. WHEN disk I/O errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN one directory fails THEN the system SHALL continue scanning other directories in the queue
6. WHEN errors accumulate THEN the system SHALL provide error summary statistics

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user scanning large directories, I want the scanner to be memory-efficient and fast, so that I can scan 100,000+ files without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning 100,000+ files THEN the system SHALL maintain memory usage below 100MB
2. WHEN scanning on SSD THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 1,000 files per minute scan rate
3. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL batch progress updates (every 100 files) instead of per-file updates
4. WHEN storing file information THEN the system SHALL use efficient data structures
5. WHEN scanning repeatedly THEN the system SHALL support optional file metadata caching
6. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL include performance benchmarks and regression tests

### Requirement 4: Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive integration tests, so that I can ensure the FileScanner works correctly with other components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrated with HashCalculator THEN the system SHALL pass file lists correctly
2. WHEN integrated with DuplicateDetector THEN the system SHALL provide compatible file information
3. WHEN running end-to-end tests THEN the system SHALL complete full scan workflows successfully
4. WHEN testing with real directories THEN the system SHALL handle various file system scenarios
5. WHEN performance testing THEN the system SHALL meet specified performance targets
6. WHEN all tests run THEN the system SHALL achieve 90%+ code coverage
