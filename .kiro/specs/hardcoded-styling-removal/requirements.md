# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DupFinder application currently contains hardcoded colors, styling, and theme elements throughout the GUI components that prevent proper theme application. These hardcoded styles override the comprehensive theme system, causing inconsistent appearance when users switch between light and dark themes. This specification addresses the systematic removal of all hardcoded styling to ensure complete theme compliance.

## Glossary

- **ThemeManager**: The centralized theme management system that provides consistent styling across the application
- **Hardcoded Styling**: Direct color values, CSS properties, or styling attributes embedded in source code rather than using theme-aware styling
- **Theme-Aware Styling**: Styling that uses palette colors and theme system properties that automatically adapt to theme changes
- **GUI Components**: User interface elements including dialogs, widgets, progress bars, and custom controls
- **Palette Colors**: Qt's color system that automatically adapts to system and application themes

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all GUI components to properly reflect my selected theme, so that the entire application has a consistent appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user changes the theme setting, THE ThemeManager SHALL ensure all GUI components update their appearance immediately
2. THE ThemeManager SHALL override any hardcoded styling that conflicts with the selected theme
3. WHILE any dialog or widget is displayed, THE ThemeManager SHALL maintain consistent theme-aware styling across all controls
4. THE ThemeManager SHALL ensure no hardcoded colors remain visible after theme application
5. WHERE custom styling is required, THE ThemeManager SHALL provide theme-aware alternatives that adapt to theme changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all styling to use theme-aware properties, so that future theme modifications automatically apply to all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GUI_Components SHALL use only palette colors and theme system properties for all visual styling
2. THE GUI_Components SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded hex colors, RGB values, or fixed color definitions
3. WHEN new GUI components are added, THE GUI_Components SHALL follow theme-aware styling patterns
4. THE GUI_Components SHALL use ThemeManager-provided stylesheets instead of inline setStyleSheet calls
5. WHERE component-specific styling is needed, THE GUI_Components SHALL request styling from ThemeManager

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want progress indicators and status displays to maintain proper contrast and visibility, so that I can clearly see application status in any theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Progress_Components SHALL use theme-aware colors for all progress bars and status indicators
2. WHEN displaying status information, THE Progress_Components SHALL ensure proper contrast ratios in both light and dark themes
3. THE Progress_Components SHALL adapt gradient colors and visual effects to match the selected theme
4. WHERE color coding is used for status (success, warning, error), THE Progress_Components SHALL use theme-appropriate color variants
5. THE Progress_Components SHALL maintain readability and accessibility standards across all themes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want custom drawing and rendering to respect my theme choice, so that all visual elements appear cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Custom_Renderers SHALL use palette colors for all drawing operations including borders, backgrounds, and text
2. WHEN performing custom painting, THE Custom_Renderers SHALL query the current theme for appropriate colors
3. THE Custom_Renderers SHALL NOT use hardcoded QColor values or fixed color constants
4. WHERE custom visual effects are needed, THE Custom_Renderers SHALL implement theme-aware alternatives
5. THE Custom_Renderers SHALL update their appearance immediately when theme changes occur

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all text and labels to have proper contrast and styling, so that content remains readable in any theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Text_Components SHALL use palette-based colors for all text rendering and backgrounds
2. WHEN displaying informational text, THE Text_Components SHALL ensure appropriate contrast ratios
3. THE Text_Components SHALL adapt font styling and emphasis to work with both light and dark themes
4. WHERE special text formatting is used, THE Text_Components SHALL use theme-aware styling properties
5. THE Text_Components SHALL maintain consistent typography that complements the selected theme

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI controls to maintain proper minimum sizes, so that text and controls remain readable and usable regardless of layout constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE UI_Controls SHALL enforce minimum width and height constraints for all interactive elements
2. WHEN layout constraints would shrink controls below usable sizes, THE UI_Controls SHALL maintain their minimum dimensions
3. THE UI_Controls SHALL ensure text boxes have sufficient height for readable text display
4. THE UI_Controls SHALL ensure dropdown controls maintain adequate width for content visibility
5. WHERE controls contain text or icons, THE UI_Controls SHALL prevent shrinking that makes content unreadable or controls unusable
