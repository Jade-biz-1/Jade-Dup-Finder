# P1 Features Specification

## Overview

This specification covers the P1 (High Priority) features for the DupFinder application. These features enhance user experience by implementing preset loading, verifying detection flow, and adding scan history persistence.

## Status

- **Requirements:** âœ… Complete and Approved
- **Design:** âœ… Complete and Approved  
- **Tasks:** âœ… Complete and Approved
- **Implementation:** ðŸ”„ Ready to Start

## Features Included

### 1. Preset Loading (Task 4)
Automatic configuration of scan dialogs based on user-selected presets:
- Quick Scan preset
- Downloads preset
- Photos preset
- Documents preset
- Full System preset
- Custom preset

### 2. Detection Flow Verification (Task 5)
Ensuring duplicate detection results properly flow to the results window:
- Automatic results display after detection
- Proper window management
- Progress indicator updates
- UI re-enabling

### 3. Scan History Persistence (Task 6)
Saving and loading scan results for future reference:
- Automatic scan saving
- History widget display
- Click to view past results
- Persistent storage across restarts
- Old scan cleanup

## Documents

- **[requirements.md](requirements.md)** - Detailed requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria
- **[design.md](design.md)** - Comprehensive design document with architecture and implementation details
- **[tasks.md](tasks.md)** - Implementation plan with 20 discrete coding tasks

## Quick Start

To begin implementing P1 features:

1. Read the requirements document to understand what needs to be built
2. Review the design document to understand how it will be built
3. Follow the tasks in order, starting with Task 1

## Files to Create

```
include/
  scan_history_manager.h          # New

src/core/
  scan_history_manager.cpp        # New

tests/unit/
  test_scan_history_manager.cpp   # New

tests/integration/
  test_preset_flow.cpp            # New
  test_detection_flow.cpp         # New
  test_history_flow.cpp           # New
```

## Files to Modify

```
include/
  scan_dialog.h                   # Add loadPreset() method
  main_window.h                   # Add helper methods

src/gui/
  scan_dialog.cpp                 # Implement loadPreset()
  main_window.cpp                 # Update handlers
  main_window_widgets.cpp         # Update refreshHistory()

CMakeLists.txt                    # Add new files
```

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- âœ… All 6 preset buttons work correctly
- âœ… Detection results display automatically
- âœ… Scan history persists across restarts
- âœ… Users can view past scan results
- âœ… All error conditions handled gracefully

### Non-Functional
- âœ… Preset loading < 10ms
- âœ… Results display < 100ms
- âœ… History save < 500ms
- âœ… History load < 200ms
- âœ… No memory leaks
- âœ… Comprehensive logging
- âœ… Clear error messages

### Testing
- âœ… All unit tests pass
- âœ… All integration tests pass
- âœ… Manual testing complete
- âœ… No critical bugs
- âœ… Performance acceptable

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Task 1:** Implement `ScanSetupDialog::loadPreset()`
2. **Test incrementally:** Verify each task before moving to the next
3. **Use the logger:** Add comprehensive logging for debugging
4. **Follow the design:** Stick to the architecture outlined in design.md
5. **Ask questions:** If anything is unclear, refer back to the requirements

## Execution

To execute a task from this spec:

1. Open the tasks.md file in Kiro
2. Click "Start task" next to the task you want to work on
3. Kiro will guide you through the implementation
4. Mark the task complete when done

## Notes

- This spec builds on the successfully completed P0 critical fixes
- All P0 features are working and tested
- The application is stable and ready for P1 enhancements
- Focus on one task at a time for best results
- Test thoroughly after each task
