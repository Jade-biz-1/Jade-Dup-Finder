# Requirements Document - P1 Features

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the P1 (High Priority) features of the DupFinder application. These features build upon the successfully completed P0 critical fixes and enhance the user experience by implementing preset loading functionality, verifying the duplicate detection flow, and adding scan history persistence. These features are essential for providing users with a smooth, efficient workflow and the ability to track their scanning activities over time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Preset Loading Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want quick action buttons to automatically configure scan settings so that I can start common scans without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a quick action preset button THEN the system SHALL open the scan dialog with pre-configured settings appropriate to that preset
2. WHEN the "Quick Scan" preset is selected THEN the system SHALL configure the dialog to scan Home, Downloads, and Documents folders with a 1MB minimum file size
3. WHEN the "Downloads" preset is selected THEN the system SHALL configure the dialog to scan only the Downloads folder with no minimum file size
4. WHEN the "Photos" preset is selected THEN the system SHALL configure the dialog to scan the Pictures folder with image file type filters
5. WHEN the "Documents" preset is selected THEN the system SHALL configure the dialog to scan the Documents folder with document file type filters
6. WHEN the "Full System" preset is selected THEN the system SHALL configure the dialog to scan the entire Home directory including hidden files
7. WHEN the "Custom" preset is selected THEN the system SHALL load the last used configuration or default settings
8. WHEN a preset is loaded THEN the user SHALL be able to modify the pre-configured settings before starting the scan
9. WHEN preset loading fails THEN the system SHALL log an error and open the dialog with default settings

### Requirement 2: Duplicate Detection Results Flow Verification

**User Story:** As a user, I want duplicate detection results to automatically display after scanning so that I can immediately review and act on the findings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate detection completes THEN the system SHALL retrieve all duplicate groups from the detector
2. WHEN duplicate groups are retrieved THEN the system SHALL create or reuse the results window
3. WHEN the results window is created THEN the system SHALL pass the file manager reference to enable file operations
4. WHEN duplicate groups are available THEN the system SHALL call displayDuplicateGroups() with the complete group list
5. WHEN the results window is populated THEN the system SHALL show, raise, and activate the window
6. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL update the progress indicator to 100% with a completion message
7. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL re-enable the quick action buttons
8. WHEN no duplicate groups are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message to the user
9. WHEN detection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and display an error message to the user

### Requirement 3: Scan History Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my scan results to be saved automatically so that I can review past scans and their findings at any time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a duplicate detection completes successfully THEN the system SHALL save the scan record to persistent storage
2. WHEN saving a scan record THEN the system SHALL include scan ID, timestamp, target paths, file count, duplicate group count, potential savings, and duplicate groups
3. WHEN a scan is saved THEN the system SHALL generate a unique scan ID using UUID
4. WHEN a scan is saved THEN the system SHALL store it in JSON format in the application data directory
5. WHEN the scan history widget is displayed THEN the system SHALL load and display all saved scan records
6. WHEN the user clicks a history item THEN the system SHALL load the corresponding scan record from storage
7. WHEN a scan record is loaded successfully THEN the system SHALL display the duplicate groups in the results window
8. WHEN a scan record fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a warning message to the user
9. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL ensure the history directory exists
10. WHEN retrieving all scans THEN the system SHALL return them sorted by timestamp in descending order
11. WHEN the user deletes a scan from history THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding file from storage
12. WHEN clearing old scans THEN the system SHALL delete scan records older than the specified retention period
13. WHEN the history widget is refreshed THEN the system SHALL reload all scan records and update the display
14. WHEN calculating potential savings THEN the system SHALL sum the sizes of all duplicate files (excluding the file to keep in each group)

### Requirement 4: Scan History Manager

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized scan history manager so that scan persistence is handled consistently throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scan history manager is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide a singleton instance
2. WHEN saving a scan THEN the system SHALL validate the scan record before persisting
3. WHEN loading a scan THEN the system SHALL return an invalid record if the scan ID is not found
4. WHEN getting all scans THEN the system SHALL return an empty list if no scans exist
5. WHEN the history directory does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically
6. WHEN a scan file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL log an error and skip that scan
7. WHEN multiple scans are saved THEN the system SHALL maintain separate files for each scan
8. WHEN the storage format changes THEN the system SHALL handle backward compatibility with older scan files

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want P1 features to work seamlessly with existing functionality so that the application feels cohesive and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preset loading is implemented THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing ScanSetupDialog without breaking current functionality
2. WHEN detection flow is verified THEN the system SHALL work with the existing DuplicateDetector and ResultsWindow
3. WHEN scan history is implemented THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing ScanHistoryWidget
4. WHEN file operations are performed THEN the system SHALL update the scan history to reflect changes
5. WHEN the application is closed THEN the system SHALL ensure all scan data is persisted
6. WHEN the logger is available THEN the system SHALL log all P1 feature operations at appropriate levels
7. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing the application
8. WHEN P1 features are used THEN the system SHALL maintain thread safety for all operations
