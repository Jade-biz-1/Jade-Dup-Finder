# Requirements Document: P3 UI Enhancements

## Introduction

This spec covers the remaining P3 (Low Priority) enhancement tasks for the Duplicate File Finder application. These tasks focus on improving the user experience of existing working features by adding polish, better visualizations, and advanced options. All core functionality is already operational; these enhancements will make the application more professional and user-friendly.

The enhancements cover five main areas:
1. Scan Configuration Dialog improvements
2. Scan Progress Display enhancements
3. Results Display improvements (thumbnails, better grouping)
4. File Selection enhancements (smart modes, history)
5. File Operations improvements (batch handling, queue)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Scan Configuration Dialog

**User Story:** As a user, I want more control over scan configuration with better validation and preset management, so that I can customize scans for different use cases and save my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user opens scan configuration dialog THEN system SHALL display current exclude patterns in a visible list
2. WHEN user adds an exclude pattern THEN system SHALL validate the pattern and add it to the list
3. WHEN user removes an exclude pattern THEN system SHALL remove it from the configuration
4. WHEN user saves a custom preset THEN system SHALL persist the preset with a user-defined name
5. WHEN user manages presets THEN system SHALL allow viewing, editing, and deleting custom presets
6. WHEN user enters invalid configuration THEN system SHALL display specific validation messages explaining the issue
7. WHEN user changes scan scope THEN system SHALL show a preview of what will be scanned (folder count, estimated file count)
8. IF scan configuration is invalid THEN system SHALL disable the Start Scan button and show why

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Scan Progress Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed progress information during scans including time estimates and scan rate, so that I can understand how long the scan will take and monitor performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scan is running THEN system SHALL display estimated time remaining based on current scan rate
2. WHEN scan is running THEN system SHALL display files per second scan rate
3. WHEN scan is running THEN system SHALL display current folder being scanned
4. WHEN scan is running THEN system SHALL display total data scanned (in MB/GB)
5. WHEN user clicks pause button THEN system SHALL pause the scan and allow resumption
6. WHEN scan is paused THEN system SHALL display "Paused" status and show resume button
7. WHEN scan completes THEN system SHALL display total scan time and files processed
8. IF scan encounters errors THEN system SHALL display error count and allow viewing error details

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Results Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual thumbnails of duplicate images and videos, better grouping options, and advanced filters, so that I can quickly identify and manage duplicates more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN results contain image files THEN system SHALL display thumbnail previews in the tree view
2. WHEN results contain video files THEN system SHALL display video thumbnail previews (first frame)
3. WHEN user hovers over a thumbnail THEN system SHALL display a larger preview tooltip
4. WHEN user selects grouping option THEN system SHALL allow grouping by: hash, size, type, date, location, or custom
5. WHEN user applies advanced filters THEN system SHALL allow filtering by: date range, file extension, path pattern, size range
6. WHEN user creates a filter preset THEN system SHALL save the filter combination for reuse
7. WHEN results contain many duplicates THEN system SHALL display duplicate relationship visualization (which files are duplicates of each other)
8. WHEN user exports results THEN system SHALL include thumbnail images in HTML export format

### Requirement 4: Enhanced File Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want smart selection modes, selection history, and selection presets, so that I can efficiently select files for operations across multiple sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user activates smart selection mode THEN system SHALL allow selection by: oldest files, newest files, largest files, smallest files, files in specific paths
2. WHEN user makes selections THEN system SHALL maintain a selection history for the current session
3. WHEN user clicks undo selection THEN system SHALL restore the previous selection state
4. WHEN user clicks redo selection THEN system SHALL restore the next selection state in history
5. WHEN user saves a selection preset THEN system SHALL persist the selection criteria with a name
6. WHEN user loads a selection preset THEN system SHALL apply the saved selection criteria to current results
7. WHEN user inverts selection THEN system SHALL select all unselected files and deselect all selected files
8. WHEN user selects by criteria THEN system SHALL allow combining multiple criteria (AND/OR logic)

### Requirement 5: Enhanced File Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want better batch operation handling with an operation queue and detailed progress, so that I can manage large file operations more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user initiates file operation THEN system SHALL add operation to a queue and show queue status
2. WHEN multiple operations are queued THEN system SHALL process them sequentially with progress for each
3. WHEN operation is running THEN system SHALL display detailed progress (current file, X of Y files, percentage, speed)
4. WHEN user cancels operation THEN system SHALL stop after current file completes and report partial completion
5. WHEN operation completes THEN system SHALL display detailed results (success count, failure count, skipped count)
6. WHEN operation fails for specific files THEN system SHALL display list of failed files with error reasons
7. WHEN user views operation history THEN system SHALL show all operations from current session with status
8. IF operation encounters errors THEN system SHALL allow user to retry failed files only

## Success Criteria

1. All five enhancement areas implemented and tested
2. UI remains responsive during all operations
3. No performance degradation from enhancements
4. All enhancements follow existing UI design patterns
5. User preferences persist across sessions
6. Enhanced features integrate seamlessly with existing functionality
7. Code maintains current quality standards (no new warnings/errors)
8. Documentation updated to reflect new features

## Out of Scope

1. Changes to core duplicate detection algorithms
2. Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS)
3. Network or cloud storage support
4. Plugin or extension system
5. Multi-language support
6. Automated duplicate resolution
7. Machine learning-based duplicate detection
8. Integration with external services

## Technical Constraints

1. Must maintain Qt 6.5+ compatibility
2. Must work on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+)
3. Must not break existing functionality
4. Must follow existing code architecture
5. Must maintain current performance levels
6. Must use existing SafetyManager for file operations
7. Must persist settings using QSettings
8. Must maintain existing signal/slot patterns

## Dependencies

1. Qt 6.5+ (already installed)
2. Existing codebase (all P0, P1, P2 tasks complete)
3. Working SafetyManager backend
4. Working Settings persistence system
5. Working Results display system

## Assumptions

1. Core functionality is working correctly
2. Test suite issues will be fixed separately
3. Users want more control and visibility
4. Performance is acceptable for enhancements
5. Current UI patterns are established and working
