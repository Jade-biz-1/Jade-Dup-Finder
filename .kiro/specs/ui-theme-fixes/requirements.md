# UI Theme & User Experience Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical user experience issues with the dark/light theme system and UI component visibility problems identified by user testing. The current theme implementation has several issues that make the application difficult to use in dark mode and affect component visibility across different dialogs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dark Mode Theme System Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dark/light theme system to work properly so that all UI components are visible and usable in both themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects dark theme in settings THEN all UI components SHALL be properly styled with dark theme colors
2. WHEN the user selects light theme in settings THEN all UI components SHALL be properly styled with light theme colors
3. WHEN the theme is changed THEN all open dialogs and windows SHALL update their appearance immediately
4. WHEN using dark theme THEN text SHALL be light colored and backgrounds SHALL be dark colored for proper contrast
5. WHEN using light theme THEN text SHALL be dark colored and backgrounds SHALL be light colored for proper contrast
6. WHEN the system theme changes THEN the application SHALL update automatically if "System Default" is selected

### Requirement 2: Results Dialog Component Visibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see checkboxes and selection controls in the results dialog so that I can select files for deletion or other operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I expand a duplicate group in results dialog THEN checkboxes for each file SHALL be visible and functional
2. WHEN using dark theme THEN checkboxes SHALL have proper contrast and be clearly visible
3. WHEN using light theme THEN checkboxes SHALL have proper contrast and be clearly visible
4. WHEN I hover over checkboxes THEN they SHALL provide visual feedback
5. WHEN I click checkboxes THEN they SHALL toggle selection state visually
6. WHEN files are selected THEN the selection count and total size SHALL update correctly

### Requirement 3: Scan Configuration Dialog Layout Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want all components in the New Scan Configuration dialog to be fully visible and properly laid out so that I can configure scans effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the New Scan Configuration dialog THEN all tabs SHALL be fully visible
2. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN all controls within each tab SHALL be fully visible and accessible
3. WHEN using different screen sizes THEN the dialog SHALL resize appropriately to show all content
4. WHEN text is too long for controls THEN it SHALL wrap or scroll appropriately
5. WHEN the dialog is resized THEN components SHALL maintain proper spacing and alignment
6. WHEN using dark theme THEN all text and controls SHALL be clearly visible with proper contrast

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Theme Application

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent theming across all dialogs and components so that the application has a professional and cohesive appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a theme is applied THEN ALL dialogs SHALL use consistent colors and styling
2. WHEN a theme is applied THEN buttons, text fields, checkboxes, and other controls SHALL be properly themed
3. WHEN a theme is applied THEN icons and graphics SHALL be appropriate for the theme (light/dark variants)
4. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN they SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback
5. WHEN elements are disabled THEN they SHALL be clearly distinguishable from enabled elements
6. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the application SHALL provide adequate contrast ratios

### Requirement 5: Theme Persistence and Settings Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my theme preference to be saved and applied consistently so that I don't have to reconfigure it every time I use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change the theme in settings THEN it SHALL be saved immediately
2. WHEN I restart the application THEN my theme preference SHALL be restored
3. WHEN I change the theme THEN it SHALL apply to all currently open windows and dialogs
4. WHEN the system theme changes THEN the application SHALL respond if "System Default" is selected
5. WHEN theme application fails THEN the application SHALL fall back to a default theme gracefully
