# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive UI/UX issues identified in the senior architect's final review of the DupFinder application. The review revealed that while significant progress has been made on UI implementation, critical issues remain that prevent proper theme application and affect user experience. This spec consolidates all remaining UI/UX issues into a systematic approach for resolution, ensuring the application meets professional standards for theme consistency, component visibility, and user experience.

## Glossary

- **ThemeManager**: The centralized theme management system responsible for consistent styling across the application
- **Hardcoded Styling**: Direct color values, CSS properties, or styling attributes embedded in source code that override theme system
- **Theme Compliance**: The state where all UI components properly follow the theme system without hardcoded overrides
- **Component Visibility**: The ability for users to clearly see and interact with UI elements in both light and dark themes
- **Theme Propagation**: The system that ensures theme changes are immediately applied to all open dialogs and windows
- **Style Validation**: Automated system to detect and report hardcoded styling that conflicts with theme system
- **GUI_Components**: All user interface elements including dialogs, widgets, progress bars, and custom controls
- **Theme_System**: The comprehensive theming infrastructure including ThemeManager, palette colors, and style sheets

## Requirements

4. THE GUI_Components SHALL provide clear visual indication of operation status including running, paused, completed, and error states
5. WHERE operations encounter errors, THE GUI_Components SHALL display error counts and provide access to detailed error information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want all custom drawing and rendering to properly respect theme colors, so that visual elements maintain consistency with the selected theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GUI_Components SHALL use only palette colors and theme-provided colors for all custom drawing operations
2. WHEN performing custom painting, THE GUI_Components SHALL query ThemeManager for appropriate colors rather than using hardcoded values
