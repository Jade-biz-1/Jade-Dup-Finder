# UI/UX Fixes Design

## Fix 1: File Thumbnail Visibility

### Analysis
The thumbnail delegate is implemented but may not be properly enabled or configured. The issue is likely in the results window setup.

### Solution
- Ensure thumbnail delegate is properly set on the tree widget
- Verify thumbnail cache is initialized and working
- Add debug logging to track thumbnail generation
- Ensure proper column configuration for thumbnails

## Fix 2: Group Selection Checkbox

### Analysis
Group items (top-level items) need checkboxes to allow bulk selection of all files in a group.

### Solution
- Add checkboxes to group items in `updateGroupItem()`
- Implement group checkbox state change handling
- When group checkbox is toggled, update all child file checkboxes
- Update selection summary when group selections change

## Fix 3: Light Theme Contrast

### Analysis
The current theme system may not have proper selection colors defined for light themes.

### Solution
- Update `applyTheme()` method in ResultsWindow to handle light theme selection colors
- Define high-contrast selection colors for light theme
- Ensure selected text remains readable
- Test with both active and inactive selection states

## Fix 4: Scan History Date Input Cutoff

### Analysis
QDateEdit widgets need proper minimum size settings to display correctly.

### Solution
- Set explicit minimum width and height for date edit widgets
- Ensure proper layout spacing and margins
- Test with different system fonts and DPI settings

## Fix 5: Loading Indicator for Large Scans

### Analysis
Need to show loading state when processing large scan results.

### Solution
- Add loading cursor and status message before processing
- Use QTimer to defer heavy operations and show progress
- Implement proper loading state management
- Show progress for operations taking >1 second

## Fix 6: Dialog Navigation

### Analysis
Need to maintain parent-child relationship between Scan History and Results dialogs.

### Solution
- Modify dialog invocation to use `hide()` instead of `accept()`
- Implement proper dialog stacking
- Add signal connections to handle dialog returns
- Ensure Scan History dialog reappears when Results dialog closes

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes
1. Fix thumbnail visibility (highest priority)
2. Fix light theme contrast (accessibility issue)
3. Fix date input cutoff (usability issue)

### Phase 2: Enhancement Fixes
1. Add group selection checkboxes
2. Implement loading indicators
3. Fix dialog navigation

### Testing Approach
- Test with both light and dark themes
- Test with different screen resolutions and DPI settings
- Test with large scan results (>1000 files)
- Test dialog navigation workflows
