# Manual Testing Guide - DupFinder

## Date: December 10, 2025
## Purpose: Step-by-step guide for testing the application manually

---

## What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing means **using the application like a real user** and checking that everything works as expected. You click buttons, enter data, and verify the results match what you expect.

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Make Sure Application is Built
```bash
# Build the application
cmake --build build --target dupfinder -j$(nproc)

# Check for errors
echo $?  # Should output 0 (success)
```

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
# Run from workspace root
./build/dupfinder

# Or run in background to see logs
./build/dupfinder > /tmp/dupfinder_test.log 2>&1 &
```

### 3. Check Application Started
```bash
# Check if running
ps aux | grep dupfinder | grep -v grep

# Should show something like:
# deepak    12345  1.0  0.1 4838508 126992 pts/2  Sl   21:21   0:00 ./build/dupfinder
```

## Quick Test (5 minutes)

If you're short on time, do this quick smoke test:

1. **Start app:** `./build/dupfinder`
2. **Click Help:** Verify dialog shows
3. **Click Quick Scan:** Verify dialog opens with presets
4. **Close dialogs**
5. **Close app**

If all 5 steps work, the critical fixes are working!

## Tips for Effective Testing

1. **Take Screenshots:** Visual proof helps track issues
2. **Note Everything:** Write down anything unexpected
3. **Test Systematically:** Follow the checklist in order
4. **Don't Skip Steps:** Each test builds on previous ones
5. **Check Logs:** Logs show what's happening behind the scenes
6. **Use Test Data:** Don't test on real important files!
7. **Be Patient:** Some operations take time
8. **Report Issues:** Note exact steps to reproduce problems

---

## Next Steps After Testing

### If All Tests Pass:
1. Document success
2. Move to next development tasks
3. Consider automated testing

### If Tests Fail:
1. Document which tests failed
2. Note error messages
3. Check logs for details
4. Report to developer (me!)
5. I'll fix the issues
