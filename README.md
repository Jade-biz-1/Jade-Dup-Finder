```bash
make format  # or ninja format
```

### Testing

✅ **Current Status**: Core test suite is stable and working!

```bash
# Build and run tests
cd build
make unit_tests
./tests/unit_tests

# Run all available tests
make check

# Core unit tests: 43/43 passing ✅
# Extended test framework available for advanced testing
```

We have a comprehensive testing infrastructure with:
- **Unit Tests**: Core functionality validation (100% stable)
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **Performance Tests**: Scalability and optimization validation  
- **Security Tests**: Safety and vulnerability assessment
- **UI Tests**: Automated interface testing
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing on all platforms

**Want to help with testing?** This is a great area for new contributors! See our [testing documentation](docs/testing/) for guides and examples.

### Platform-Specific Development

#### Windows Development
- Use Visual Studio 2019+ with Qt VS Tools extension
- Ensure Qt6 is in your PATH or set Qt6_DIR
- For MSVC builds, install Visual C++ Redistributable

#### macOS Development  
- Use Xcode or Qt Creator
- Install Qt6 via Homebrew or Qt Installer
- Code signing required for distribution

#### Linux Development
- Install Qt6 development packages
- GCC 9+ or Clang 10+ recommended
- Install platform-specific packages for your distribution

## 📦 Distribution

### Creating Packages
```bash
# In build directory
make package    # Creates platform-specific packages
```

This generates:
- **Windows**: `.exe` installer (NSIS)
- **macOS**: `.dmg` disk image
- **Linux**: `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.tar.gz` packages

### Continuous Integration
GitHub Actions automatically builds and tests on all platforms. See `.github/workflows/` for configuration.
