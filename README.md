## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Qt 6.0 or later
- CMake 3.20 or later  
- Modern C++17 compatible compiler:
  - Windows: Visual Studio 2019+ or MinGW-w64
  - macOS: Xcode 12+ (Clang)
  - Linux: GCC 9+ or Clang 10+

### Building from Source

#### Unified Build Orchestrator (Recommended)

DupFinder uses `scripts/build.py`, an intelligent build orchestrator that selects the
correct toolchain (CPU/GPU, OS, architecture) and copies finished installers
into the standardized `dist/` layout.

**Quick Start:**

1. **Configure your build environment:**
   - **Option A (Recommended):** Edit individual profile files for platforms you'll use:
     - Windows: `config/build_profiles_windows-msvc-cpu.json` or `config/build_profiles_windows-msvc-cuda.json`
     - Linux: `config/build_profiles_linux-cpu.json` or `config/build_profiles_linux-gpu.json`
     - macOS: `config/build_profiles_macos-x86_64.json` or `config/build_profiles_macos-arm64.json`
   - **Option B (Legacy):** Copy `config/build_profiles.example.json` to `config/build_profiles.json`
   - See [LOCAL_SETTINGS.md](LOCAL_SETTINGS.md) for reference configurations and examples

2. **List available build targets:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/build.py --list-targets
   ```

3. **Run interactive build:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/build.py
   ```
   The script detects your OS and GPU, shows available targets, and builds after confirmation.

4. **Find your artifacts:**
   - Windows: `dist/Win64/{Debug,Release}/`
   - Linux: `dist/Linux/{Debug,Release}/` (includes DEB, RPM, and TGZ packages)
   - macOS: `dist/MacOS/{X64,ARM}/{Debug,Release}/`

**For CI/CD and automation:**
```bash
python scripts/build.py --target <target-id> --build-type Release --non-interactive
```

**For comprehensive build system documentation, see [docs/BUILD_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](docs/BUILD_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)**

#### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dupfinder.git
cd dupfinder
```

#### Manual Build (Alternative to build.py)

If you prefer manual CMake configuration instead of using the build orchestrator:

**Linux/Ubuntu Build:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev

# Configure with CMake
cmake -S . -B build -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build
cmake --build build --parallel

# Run
./build/dupfinder
```

**Windows Build:**
```cmd
# Using Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt
# Set Qt6_DIR environment variable first:
# set Qt6_DIR=C:\Qt6\6.9.3\msvc2022_64

cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release

# Run
build\Release\dupfinder.exe
```

**macOS Build:**
```bash
# Install dependencies (using Homebrew)
brew install cmake ninja qt6

# Configure with CMake
cmake -S . -B build -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build
cmake --build build --parallel

# Run
open ./build/dupfinder.app
```

**Note:** Manual builds don't automatically copy artifacts to `dist/`. Use `scripts/build.py` for automated packaging and distribution.

```

### Testing

✅ **Current Status**: Core test suite is stable and working!

```bash
# Build and run tests
cd build
make unit_tests
./tests/unit_tests

# Run all available tests
make check

# Core unit tests: 43/43 passing ✅
# Extended test framework available for advanced testing
```

We have a comprehensive testing infrastructure with:
- **Unit Tests**: Core functionality validation (100% stable)
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **Performance Tests**: Scalability and optimization validation  
- **Security Tests**: Safety and vulnerability assessment
- **UI Tests**: Automated interface testing
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing on all platforms

**Want to help with testing?** This is a great area for new contributors! See our [testing documentation](docs/testing/) for guides and examples.

### Platform-Specific Development

#### Windows Development
- Use Visual Studio 2019+ with Qt VS Tools extension
- Ensure Qt6 is in your PATH or set Qt6_DIR
- For MSVC builds, install Visual C++ Redistributable

#### macOS Development  
- Use Xcode or Qt Creator
- Install Qt6 via Homebrew or Qt Installer
- Code signing required for distribution

#### Linux Development
- Install Qt6 development packages
- GCC 9+ or Clang 10+ recommended
- Install platform-specific packages for your distribution

## 📦 Distribution

### Creating Packages

**Using build.py (Recommended):**
```bash
python scripts/build.py --target <target-id> --build-type Release
```

Automatically creates platform-specific packages and copies them to `dist/`:

- **Windows**: NSIS installer (`.exe`)
  - `dist/Win64/Release/dupfinder-<version>-win64-<variant>.exe`
- **Linux**: Multiple package formats
  - `dist/Linux/Release/dupfinder-<version>-linux-x86_64-<variant>.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu)
  - `dist/Linux/Release/dupfinder-<version>-linux-x86_64-<variant>.rpm` (RedHat/Fedora)
  - `dist/Linux/Release/dupfinder-<version>-linux-x86_64-<variant>.tgz` (Universal)
- **macOS**: Disk image (`.dmg`)
  - `dist/MacOS/{X64,ARM}/Release/dupfinder-<version>-macos-<arch>.dmg`

**Manual packaging:**
```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --target package
```

### Build Variants

- **Windows**: `msvc-cpu`, `msvc-cuda` (GPU), `mingw-cpu`
- **Linux**: `cpu`, `gpu` (CUDA)
- **macOS**: `x86_64` (Intel), `arm64` (Apple Silicon)

### Continuous Integration
GitHub Actions can automatically build and test on all platforms. Configure with `scripts/build.py --non-interactive` for CI/CD pipelines.
