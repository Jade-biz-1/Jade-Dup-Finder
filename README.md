## 🔧 Development

### Code Style
We use `clang-format` for consistent code formatting. Run the formatter with:
```bash
make format  # or ninja format
```

### Testing

⚠️ **Current Status**: Test suite requires fixes before automated testing works.

```bash
# Build main application (works)
cd build
make dupfinder
./dupfinder

# Tests currently failing - see docs/TESTING_STATUS.md
# make check   # Currently fails due to signal implementation issues
# ctest -R unit_tests        # Requires fixes
# ctest -R integration_tests # Requires fixes

# Manual testing recommended until issues resolved
```

For current testing status and resolution plan, see [`docs/TESTING_STATUS.md`](docs/TESTING_STATUS.md).

### Platform-Specific Development

#### Windows Development
- Use Visual Studio 2019+ with Qt VS Tools extension
- Ensure Qt6 is in your PATH or set Qt6_DIR
- For MSVC builds, install Visual C++ Redistributable

#### macOS Development  
- Use Xcode or Qt Creator
- Install Qt6 via Homebrew or Qt Installer
- Code signing required for distribution

#### Linux Development
- Install Qt6 development packages
- GCC 9+ or Clang 10+ recommended
- Install platform-specific packages for your distribution

## 📦 Distribution

### Creating Packages
```bash
# In build directory
make package    # Creates platform-specific packages
```

This generates:
- **Windows**: `.exe` installer (NSIS)
- **macOS**: `.dmg` disk image
- **Linux**: `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.tar.gz` packages

### Continuous Integration
GitHub Actions automatically builds and tests on all platforms. See `.github/workflows/` for configuration.

## 🛡️ Safety Features

DupFinder prioritizes data safety:
- **No Permanent Deletion**: Files are always moved to system trash/recycle bin
- **Undo Operations**: Recent operations can be undone within the session
- **System File Protection**: Automatic exclusion of critical system files
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Clear summaries before any file operations
- **Session Logging**: Complete log of all operations for recovery if needed

## 📊 Use Cases

### Primary Scenarios
1. **Disk Space Cleanup**: Free up storage space by removing duplicate files
2. **Download Folder Management**: Clean up accumulated duplicate downloads
3. **Photo Library Organization**: Consolidate duplicate photos from multiple devices

### Target Users
- **General Home Users**: Non-technical users wanting simple disk cleanup
- **Storage-Conscious Users**: People running low on disk space
- **Digital Asset Managers**: Users with large media collections

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **Duplicate Detection Engine**: Multi-algorithm approach (size+name, hash-based, media-specific)
- **File System Interface**: Cross-platform file operations with Qt6
- **Safety Manager**: Handles safe deletion and recovery operations
- **UI Controllers**: Modern Qt6 Widgets-based interface

### Threading Model
- Background scanning with progress updates
- Separate threads for I/O operations and hash computation
- Responsive UI during all operations
