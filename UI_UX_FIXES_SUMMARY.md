# UI/UX Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented fixes for all 6 critical UI/UX issues identified during user testing.

## Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Fix 1: File Thumbnail Visibility
**Files Modified**: `src/gui/results_window.cpp`
- **Issue**: Thumbnails were not visible in the results tree view
- **Solution**: 
  - Ensured thumbnail delegate is properly enabled with `setThumbnailsEnabled(true)`
  - Set explicit thumbnail size with `setThumbnailSize(THUMBNAIL_SIZE)`
  - Added debug logging to track thumbnail configuration
- **Result**: Image file thumbnails now display correctly in the first column

### ✅ Fix 2: Group Selection Checkboxes
**Files Modified**: `src/gui/results_window.cpp`
- **Issue**: No checkboxes appeared for group items to select entire groups
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced `updateGroupItem()` to ensure group checkboxes are visible
  - Completely rewrote checkbox handling logic to support both group and file selections
  - Added tri-state checkbox support (unchecked/partial/checked) for groups
  - When group checkbox is toggled, all child file checkboxes update automatically
  - When individual files are toggled, group checkbox reflects the state (partial if some selected)
- **Result**: Users can now select entire groups with one click, and group checkboxes show accurate state

### ✅ Fix 3: Light Theme Contrast Issues
**Files Modified**: `src/gui/results_window.cpp`
- **Issue**: Poor contrast in Light theme made selected text unreadable
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced `applyTheme()` method with theme-specific selection colors
  - Light theme: Blue selection (#0078d7) with white text, light blue inactive selection (#e3f2fd)
  - Dark theme: Blue selection with white text, dark gray inactive selection (#404040)
  - Added hover states for better visual feedback
  - Added debug logging to track theme application
- **Result**: Excellent contrast in both light and dark themes, text remains readable when selected

### ✅ Fix 4: Scan History Date Input Cutoff
**Files Modified**: `src/gui/scan_history_dialog.cpp`
- **Issue**: Date input boxes were cut off from bottom and right
- **Solution**:
  - Increased minimum width from 120px to 140px
  - Increased minimum height from 30px to 32px
  - Added explicit size policy `QSizePolicy::Preferred, QSizePolicy::Fixed`
  - Ensured proper spacing for calendar popup functionality
- **Result**: Date inputs are fully visible and functional across different DPI settings

### ✅ Fix 5: Loading Indicator for Large Scans
**Files Modified**: `src/gui/scan_history_dialog.cpp`
- **Issue**: No loading feedback when viewing large scan results (>1000 files)
- **Solution**:
  - Added threshold check for scans with >1000 files
  - Show wait cursor (`Qt::WaitCursor`) during loading
  - Update button text to "Loading..." and disable it temporarily
  - Display informative status message with file count
  - Use `QTimer::singleShot()` to defer loading and allow UI updates
  - Restore all UI elements after loading completes
- **Result**: Clear loading feedback for large operations, prevents "Force Quit" dialogs

### ✅ Fix 6: Dialog Navigation Flow
**Files Modified**: `src/gui/main_window.cpp`
- **Issue**: Closing Results dialog didn't return to Scan History dialog
- **Solution**:
  - Modified main window's scan history dialog connection
  - Added `windowClosed` signal connection from Results window
  - When Results window closes, automatically show Scan History dialog again
  - Maintains proper dialog stacking and focus management
- **Result**: Seamless workflow - users return to Scan History when closing Results

## Technical Details

### Code Quality Improvements
