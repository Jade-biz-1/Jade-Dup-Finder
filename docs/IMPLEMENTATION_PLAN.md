1. **Start with Phase 1.1.1**: Implement FileScanner component
2. **Set up development workflow**: Code review process, issue tracking
3. **Create development environment**: IDE setup, debugging tools
4. **Begin unit test framework**: Test-driven development approach

### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1**: FileScanner component complete
- **Week 2**: HashCalculator component complete  
- **Week 3**: DuplicateDetector component complete
- **Week 4**: Integration testing and bug fixes
- **Week 5**: Basic GUI implementation starts

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap from the current state to a production-ready, cross-platform duplicate file finder with commercial viability. Each phase builds incrementally toward the final product while maintaining quality and safety as core principles.
