### T5: Verify Detection Results Flow (P1 - High)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Read full `onDuplicateDetectionCompleted()` implementation
2. Verify it calls `m_duplicateDetector->getDuplicateGroups()`
3. Verify it passes groups to `m_resultsWindow->displayDuplicateGroups()`
4. Verify ResultsWindow displays them correctly
5. Test end-to-end: scan → detect → display

**Expected Implementation:**
```cpp
void MainWindow::onDuplicateDetectionCompleted(int totalGroups)
{
    LOG_INFO(QString("=== Duplicate Detection Completed ==="));
    LOG_INFO(QString("  - Groups found: %1").arg(totalGroups));
    
    // Get results
    QList<DuplicateDetector::DuplicateGroup> groups = 
        m_duplicateDetector->getDuplicateGroups();
    
    // Show in results window
    if (!m_resultsWindow) {
        m_resultsWindow = new ResultsWindow(this);
        if (m_fileManager) {
            m_resultsWindow->setFileManager(m_fileManager);
        }
    }
    
    m_resultsWindow->displayDuplicateGroups(groups);
    m_resultsWindow->show();
    m_resultsWindow->raise();
    m_resultsWindow->activateWindow();
    
    // Update UI
    updateScanProgress(100, tr("Found %1 duplicate groups").arg(totalGroups));
    if (m_quickActions) {
        m_quickActions->setEnabled(true);
    }
}
```

**Files to Check:**
- `src/gui/main_window.cpp` - Read full method
- `src/gui/results_window.cpp` - Verify displayDuplicateGroups()

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Detection completion triggers results display
- [ ] All duplicate groups are shown
- [ ] Statistics are accurate
- [ ] UI is re-enabled after detection

### T6: Implement Scan History Persistence (P1 - High)

**Implementation:**

**1. Create ScanHistoryManager:**
```cpp
// include/scan_history_manager.h
class ScanHistoryManager : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    struct ScanRecord {
        QString scanId;
        QDateTime timestamp;
        QStringList targetPaths;
        int filesScanned;
        int duplicateGroups;
        qint64 potentialSavings;
        QList<DuplicateDetector::DuplicateGroup> groups;
        
        bool isValid() const { return !scanId.isEmpty(); }
    };
    
    static ScanHistoryManager* instance();
    
    void saveScan(const ScanRecord& record);
    ScanRecord loadScan(const QString& scanId);
    QList<ScanRecord> getAllScans();
    void deleteScan(const QString& scanId);
    void clearOldScans(int daysToKeep = 30);
    
private:
    QString getHistoryFilePath() const;
    void ensureHistoryDirectory();
};
```

**2. Save after detection:**
```cpp
void MainWindow::onDuplicateDetectionCompleted(int totalGroups)
{
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Save to history
    ScanHistoryManager::ScanRecord record;
    record.scanId = QUuid::createUuid().toString();
    record.timestamp = QDateTime::currentDateTime();
    record.targetPaths = m_lastScanConfiguration.targetPaths;
    record.filesScanned = m_lastScanResults.size();
    record.duplicateGroups = totalGroups;
    record.groups = groups;
    record.potentialSavings = calculatePotentialSavings(groups);
    
    ScanHistoryManager::instance()->saveScan(record);
    
    // Update history widget
    if (m_scanHistory) {
        m_scanHistory->refreshHistory();
    }
}
```

**3. Load when clicked:**
```cpp
void MainWindow::onScanHistoryItemClicked(int index)
{
    LOG_INFO(QString("User clicked history item: %1").arg(index));
    
    QList<ScanHistoryWidget::ScanHistoryItem> history = m_scanHistory->getHistory();
    if (index >= 0 && index < history.size()) {
        const auto& item = history[index];
        
        // Load from history
        ScanHistoryManager::ScanRecord record = 
            ScanHistoryManager::instance()->loadScan(item.scanId);
        
        if (record.isValid()) {
            // Show in results window
            if (!m_resultsWindow) {
                m_resultsWindow = new ResultsWindow(this);
                if (m_fileManager) {
                    m_resultsWindow->setFileManager(m_fileManager);
                }
            }
            
            m_resultsWindow->displayDuplicateGroups(record.groups);
            m_resultsWindow->show();
            m_resultsWindow->raise();
            m_resultsWindow->activateWindow();
        } else {
            QMessageBox::warning(this, tr("Load Error"),
                tr("Could not load scan results. The scan may have been deleted."));
        }
    }
}
```
