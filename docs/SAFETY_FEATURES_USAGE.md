**Feature:** T17 - Enhance Safety Features UI  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  
**Date:** October 16, 2025

## Overview

The Safety Features UI provides a comprehensive interface for managing the SafetyManager's file protection capabilities. This dialog allows users to configure protection rules, safety settings, view system paths, and monitor safety statistics.

## Accessing the Feature

### Main Window Access

**Features:**
- View all active protection rules
- Add new protection rules
- Edit existing rules
- Remove unwanted rules
- Test file protection status

**Protection Levels:**
- **None:** No protection applied
- **Read Only:** Prevents modifications, allows read operations
- **System:** System file protection, prevents all operations
- **Critical:** Requires explicit confirmation, creates mandatory backups

### 2. Settings Tab
**Purpose:** Configure global safety settings

**Features:**
- **Safety Level:** Choose between Minimal, Standard, or Maximum protection
- **Backup Strategy:** Configure how backups are created and stored
- **Backup Directory:** Set location for backup files
- **Retention Settings:** Configure backup age and undo operation limits

**Safety Levels:**
- **Minimal:** Basic validation only, suitable for experienced users
- **Standard:** Balanced safety and performance (recommended)
- **Maximum:** Full protection with some performance impact

### 3. System Paths Tab
**Purpose:** View and manage system-protected paths

**Features:**
- View automatically protected system directories

3. **Add custom paths** using "Add System Path" button
4. **Remove unwanted paths** if needed

## Best Practices

### Initial Setup
1. **Start with Standard safety level** for balanced protection
2. **Review system paths** to understand what's protected
3. **Add custom rules** for important personal directories
4. **Test protection** on sample files before major operations

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. **Monitor statistics** regularly to understand system usage
2. **Update protection rules** as file organization changes
3. **Review backup usage** to manage disk space
4. **Adjust safety level** based on experience and needs

## Troubleshooting

### Dialog Won't Open
**Possible Causes:**
- SafetyManager not initialized
- Memory constraints

**Solutions:**
- Restart application
- Check system resources
- Verify SafetyManager configuration

### Protection Not Working
**Possible Causes:**
