## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well:
1. **Systematic Approach:** UI audit before fixes was valuable
2. **User Stories:** Helped prioritize work effectively
3. **Quick Wins:** T2 and T3 were fast, high-impact fixes
4. **Logger:** Comprehensive logging helps debugging

### Challenges:
1. **Mutex Deadlock:** Logger had deadlock, fixed by releasing mutex before logging
2. **Macro Arguments:** LOG_INFO requires 2 args (category, message)
3. **File Truncation:** Had to search for method implementations

### Improvements:
1. **Better Planning:** User stories upfront saved time
2. **Documentation:** Comprehensive docs help track progress
3. **Incremental:** Small, testable changes work better
