# Checkbox Functionality Fix - SUCCESS ✅

## Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The checkbox functionality in the "Duplicate Files Results" dialog has been successfully fixed and is now working properly.

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Group Selection Checkbox ✅
- **Problem**: Group selection checkbox was unresponsive
- **Solution**: Fixed checkbox state handling with proper recursive update prevention
- **Result**: Group checkboxes now properly select/deselect all files in the group

### 2. File Selection Checkboxes ✅  
- **Problem**: Individual file checkboxes were not clickable
- **Solution**: Rewrote ThumbnailDelegate with manual checkbox rendering and proper event handling
- **Result**: File checkboxes are now fully functional and responsive
