# GPU Build Issues - Future Action Required

## Issue Summary
During the build process, we encountered GPU-related dependency issues that need to be addressed when GPU acceleration features are planned for implementation.

## Current Status
- **Main Application**: ✅ Builds successfully without GPU dependencies
- **GPU Features**: ⚠️ Not currently implemented, build issues deferred
- **Impact**: No impact on current functionality

## Identified GPU-Related Build Issues

### 1. Missing GPU Libraries
**Error Pattern**: Missing GPU acceleration libraries during linking phase
- OpenCL development libraries not found
- CUDA toolkit dependencies missing
- Vulkan compute shader support unavailable

### 2. GPU Hash Calculation Dependencies
**Location**: `src/core/hash_calculator.cpp` (GPU acceleration code paths)
**Issue**: GPU-accelerated hashing code exists but dependencies not configured
**Impact**: Falls back to CPU-only implementation

### 3. GPU Memory Management
**Location**: Performance optimization modules
**Issue**: GPU memory allocation and management code present but libraries missing
**Fallback**: Uses system RAM only

### 4. Test Suite GPU Components
**Location**: `tests/performance/` directory
**Issue**: GPU performance benchmarks cannot compile without GPU development libraries
**Current Solution**: GPU tests disabled in CMakeLists.txt

## Technical Details

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# These packages will be needed for GPU support:
- opencl-dev / opencl-headers
- nvidia-cuda-toolkit (for NVIDIA GPUs)
- vulkan-dev / vulkan-tools
- mesa-opencl-icd (for AMD GPUs)
```

### CMake Configuration Issues
```cmake
# These CMake modules need to be configured:
find_package(OpenCL)
find_package(CUDA)
find_package(Vulkan)
```

### Code Locations Affected
1. **Hash Calculator GPU Acceleration**
   - File: `src/core/hash_calculator.cpp`
   - Lines: GPU-specific hash computation methods
   - Status: Conditionally compiled out

2. **Memory Management GPU Buffers**
   - File: `src/core/memory_manager.cpp`
   - Feature: GPU buffer allocation
   - Status: Falls back to CPU memory

3. **Performance Tests GPU Benchmarks**
   - Directory: `tests/performance/gpu/`
   - Status: Excluded from build

## Future Action Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
When GPU acceleration is planned:
1. **Install GPU Development Libraries**
   ```bash
   # For NVIDIA systems:
   sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit opencl-dev
   
   # For AMD systems:
   sudo apt install mesa-opencl-icd opencl-dev
   
   # For Intel systems:
   sudo apt install intel-opencl-icd opencl-dev
   ```

2. **Update CMakeLists.txt**
   - Enable GPU dependency detection
   - Add conditional compilation flags
   - Include GPU-specific source files

### Phase 2: Code Integration
1. **Enable GPU Hash Calculation**
   - Uncomment GPU acceleration code in hash_calculator.cpp
   - Test GPU vs CPU performance benchmarks
   - Implement fallback mechanisms

2. **GPU Memory Management**
   - Enable GPU buffer allocation
   - Implement GPU-CPU memory transfer
   - Add GPU memory usage monitoring

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Enable GPU performance test suite
   - Add GPU vs CPU comparison benchmarks
   - Validate GPU acceleration benefits

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. **GPU Algorithm Optimization**
   - Optimize hash algorithms for GPU architecture
   - Implement parallel file processing
   - Add GPU workload balancing

2. **Memory Optimization**
   - Optimize GPU memory usage patterns
   - Implement efficient data transfer
   - Add GPU memory leak detection

## Current Workarounds

### Build Configuration
```cmake
# Current CMakeLists.txt has GPU features disabled:
option(ENABLE_GPU_ACCELERATION "Enable GPU acceleration" OFF)

# When ready to enable:
option(ENABLE_GPU_ACCELERATION "Enable GPU acceleration" ON)
```

### Runtime Detection
```cpp
// Current code includes GPU capability detection:
bool hasGPUSupport() {
    // Returns false until GPU libraries are available
    return false; // TODO: Enable when GPU support is implemented
}
```

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Current Performance (CPU Only)
- Hash calculation: CPU-bound, uses all available cores
- Memory usage: System RAM only
- Throughput: Limited by CPU and storage I/O

### Expected GPU Performance Gains
- Hash calculation: 5-10x speedup for large files
- Memory bandwidth: Higher throughput for data processing
- Parallel processing: Massive parallelization of duplicate detection

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Current CPU implementation is stable and performant
- GPU features are optional enhancements
- Fallback mechanisms are in place

### Medium Risk
- GPU driver compatibility issues
- Different GPU vendors require different approaches
- Additional complexity in build system

### Mitigation Strategy
- Keep CPU implementation as primary
- GPU acceleration as optional feature
- Comprehensive testing on multiple GPU types
