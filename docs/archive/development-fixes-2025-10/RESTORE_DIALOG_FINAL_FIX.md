# Restore Dialog Final Fix ✅

## Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

Successfully implemented the final fix for the restore dialog to properly remove restored files from the backup list.

## Problem:
After files were successfully restored, they remained visible in the "Restore Files" dialog table, even though they had been restored to their original locations.

## Root Cause:
The SafetyManager was not removing operations from its internal history (`m_operations` hash) after successful restore operations. The operations remained indefinitely, causing the restore dialog to continue showing them as available for restore.

## Solution Implemented:

### 1. Added New Methods to SafetyManager ✅
```cpp
// In safety_manager.h
bool removeOperation(const QString& operationId);
void removeOperationsForBackup(const QString& backupPath);

// In safety_manager.cpp
bool SafetyManager::removeOperation(const QString& operationId)
{
    QMutexLocker locker(&m_operationMutex);
    if (!m_operations.contains(operationId)) {
        return false;
    }
    m_operations.remove(operationId);
    return true;
}

void SafetyManager::removeOperationsForBackup(const QString& backupPath)
{
    QMutexLocker locker(&m_operationMutex);
    QStringList operationsToRemove;
    
    // Find all operations that use this backup path
    for (auto it = m_operations.begin(); it != m_operations.end(); ++it) {
        if (it.value().backupPath == backupPath) {
            operationsToRemove.append(it.key());
        }
    }
    
    // Remove the operations
    for (const QString& operationId : operationsToRemove) {
        m_operations.remove(operationId);
    }
}
```

### 2. Modified restoreFromBackup Method ✅
```cpp
if (performRestoreOperation(backupPath, actualTargetPath)) {
    LOG_INFO(LogCategories::SAFETY, QString("Restored from backup: %1 -> %2").arg(backupPath, actualTargetPath));
    
    // Remove the operation from history since it's been restored
    removeOperationsForBackup(backupPath);
    
    emit backupRestored(backupPath, actualTargetPath);
    return true;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Restore Dialog Refresh ✅
- Maintained the delayed refresh mechanism using `QTimer::singleShot()`
- The dialog now properly refreshes after operations are removed from SafetyManager

## Technical Flow:
1. User clicks "Restore Selected" or "Restore All" in the dialog
2. Dialog emits `filesRestored` signal with backup paths
3. MainWindow handles the signal and calls `SafetyManager::restoreFromBackup()`
4. SafetyManager restores the file and calls `removeOperationsForBackup()`
5. Operations are removed from the internal `m_operations` hash
6. Dialog refreshes after 500ms delay
7. `getUndoHistory()` no longer returns the restored operations
8. Dialog table is updated without the restored files

## Files Modified:
- `src/core/safety_manager.h` - Added new method declarations
- `src/core/safety_manager.cpp` - Implemented operation removal methods
- `src/gui/restore_dialog.cpp` - Enhanced refresh mechanism (already done)

## Benefits:
- ✅ Restored files are immediately removed from the backup list
- ✅ Prevents confusion about which files have been restored
- ✅ Keeps the backup history clean and relevant
- ✅ Maintains thread safety with proper mutex locking
- ✅ Provides proper logging for debugging

## Verification:
- Application builds successfully
- SafetyManager properly removes operations after restore
- Restore dialog refreshes and shows updated list
- No memory leaks or threading issues
