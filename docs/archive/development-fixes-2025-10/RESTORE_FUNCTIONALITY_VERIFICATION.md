# Restore Functionality Verification Guide\n\n## 🎯 **What We Fixed**\n\nThe restore functionality was broken because **FileManager wasn't registering operations with SafetyManager**. We've now fixed this issue completely.\n\n### **Root Cause**\n- ✅ **Backups were being created** correctly\n- ❌ **Operations weren't being registered** in SafetyManager's operation history\n- ❌ **RestoreDialog was empty** because `getUndoHistory()` returned no operations\n\n### **Solution Applied**\nUpdated `src/core/file_manager.cpp` to properly register operations:\n\n```cpp\n// Before (BROKEN)\nif (m_safetyManager && m_createBackupsByDefault) {\n    QString backupPath = m_safetyManager->createBackup(filePath, ...);\n    // Missing: No operation registration!\n}\n\n// After (FIXED)\nif (m_safetyManager) {\n    // 1. Register the operation\n    QString safetyOperationId = m_safetyManager->registerOperation(\n        SafetyManager::OperationType::Delete, \n        filePath, QString(), operationId);\n    \n    // 2. Create backup if enabled\n    if (m_createBackupsByDefault) {\n        QString backupPath = m_safetyManager->createBackup(filePath, ...);\n    }\n    \n    // 3. Perform actual file operation\n    QFile file(filePath);\n    if (!file.remove()) {\n        m_safetyManager->finalizeOperation(safetyOperationId, false);\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    // 4. Mark operation as successful with backup path\n    m_safetyManager->finalizeOperation(safetyOperationId, true, backupPath);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 **How to Verify the Fix**\n\n### **Method 1: Manual Testing (Recommended)**\n\n1. **Build and run the application**:\n   ```bash\n   cd build\n   make cloneclean\n   ./cloneclean\n   ```\n\n2. **Create test scenario**:\n   - Create a folder with some duplicate files\n   - Use any method (copy files, download duplicates, etc.)\n\n3. **Test the workflow**:\n   - **Scan for duplicates** → Use \"New Scan\" or Quick Actions\n   - **Delete some files** → Select duplicates and click \"Delete Selected\"\n   - **Open Restore Dialog** → Click 🔄 Restore button or press Ctrl+Z\n   - **Verify files appear** → Deleted files should be listed in the dialog\n   - **Test restore** → Select a file and click \"Restore\"\n   - **Verify restoration** → File should be restored to original location\n\n### **Method 2: Code Verification**\n\nCheck that these components work together:\n\n#### **1. FileManager Registration (src/core/file_manager.cpp)**\n```cpp\n// Look for these patterns in performDelete() and performMove()\nQString safetyOperationId = m_safetyManager->registerOperation(...);\n// ... perform operation ...\nm_safetyManager->finalizeOperation(safetyOperationId, success, backupPath);\n```\n\n#### **2. SafetyManager History (src/core/safety_manager.cpp)**\n```cpp\n// Verify getUndoHistory() returns operations\nQList<SafetyOperation> SafetyManager::getUndoHistory(int maxResults) const {\n    // Should return operations from m_operations hash\n}\n```\n\n#### **3. RestoreDialog Population (src/gui/restore_dialog.cpp)**\n```cpp\n// Verify loadBackups() calls SafetyManager\nvoid RestoreDialog::loadBackups() {\n    m_allBackups = m_safetyManager->getUndoHistory(1000);\n    // Should populate the dialog table\n}\n```\n\n#### **4. MainWindow Integration (src/gui/main_window.cpp)**\n```cpp\n// Verify onRestoreRequested() creates dialog and handles restore\nvoid MainWindow::onRestoreRequested() {\n    RestoreDialog* restoreDialog = new RestoreDialog(m_safetyManager, this);\n    // Should connect filesRestored signal and handle restoration\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 **Expected Test Results**\n\n### **✅ Before Fix (Broken State)**\n1. Scan for duplicates → ✅ Works\n2. Delete files → ✅ Files deleted, backups created\n3. Open Restore Dialog → ❌ **Empty dialog** (\"No backups found\")\n4. Try to restore → ❌ **Nothing to restore**\n\n### **✅ After Fix (Working State)**\n1. Scan for duplicates → ✅ Works\n2. Delete files → ✅ Files deleted, backups created, **operations registered**\n3. Open Restore Dialog → ✅ **Shows deleted files** with details\n4. Filter by \"Delete\" → ✅ **Shows only deleted files**\n5. Select and restore → ✅ **Files restored to original locations**\n6. Verify content → ✅ **Original content preserved**\n\n---\n\n## 📋 **Detailed Test Checklist**\n\n### **Pre-Test Setup**\n- [ ] Application builds successfully\n- [ ] Create test directory with duplicate files\n- [ ] Verify SafetyManager is initialized in MainWindow\n\n### **Core Functionality Tests**\n- [ ] **Scan Detection**: Find duplicate files\n- [ ] **File Deletion**: Delete selected duplicates\n- [ ] **Backup Creation**: Verify backup files exist in backup directory\n- [ ] **Operation Registration**: Check that operations appear in restore dialog\n\n### **Restore Dialog Tests**\n- [ ] **Dialog Opens**: Restore button/Ctrl+Z opens dialog\n- [ ] **Operations Listed**: Deleted files appear in table\n- [ ] **Search Function**: Can search for specific files\n- [ ] **Filter Function**: Can filter by operation type (Delete/Move)\n- [ ] **File Details**: Shows original path, date, size, backup location\n- [ ] **Status Indicators**: Shows \"✓ Available\" for existing backups\n\n### **Restore Operation Tests**\n- [ ] **Single File Restore**: Select one file and restore\n- [ ] **Multiple File Restore**: Select multiple files and restore\n- [ ] **Restore All**: Use \"Restore All\" button\n- [ ] **Content Verification**: Restored files have original content\n- [ ] **Location Verification**: Files restored to original paths\n- [ ] **Conflict Handling**: Test restoring when file already exists\n\n### **Error Handling Tests**\n- [ ] **Missing Backup**: Handle case where backup file is deleted\n- [ ] **Permission Issues**: Handle read-only directories\n- [ ] **Disk Space**: Handle insufficient disk space\n- [ ] **Invalid Paths**: Handle corrupted backup paths\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**\n\n### **If Restore Dialog is Still Empty**\n\n1. **Check SafetyManager Initialization**:\n   ```cpp\n   // In MainWindow constructor, verify:\n   m_fileManager->setSafetyManager(m_safetyManager);\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Operation Registration**:\n   - Add debug logging in `FileManager::performDelete()`\n   - Verify `registerOperation()` is called\n   - Verify `finalizeOperation()` is called with success=true\n\n3. **Check Backup Creation**:\n   - Verify backup directory exists and is writable\n   - Check that `m_createBackupsByDefault` is true\n   - Verify backup files are actually created\n\n4. **Check Dialog Loading**:\n   - Add debug logging in `RestoreDialog::loadBackups()`\n   - Verify `getUndoHistory()` returns operations\n   - Check that operations have valid backup paths\n\n### **If Restore Operations Fail**\n\n1. **Check Backup File Existence**:\n   ```cpp\n   QFile::exists(operation.backupPath)  // Should be true\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Original Path Resolution**:\n   ```cpp\n   QString originalPath = m_safetyManager->getOriginalPathForBackup(backupPath);\n   ```\n\n3. **Check File Permissions**:\n   - Verify write permissions to target directory\n   - Check if target file is read-only\n\n4. **Check Disk Space**:\n   - Ensure sufficient space for restoration\n   - Verify backup file is not corrupted\n\n---\n\n## 📊 **Success Metrics**\n\n### **Functional Success**\n- ✅ RestoreDialog shows deleted files (not empty)\n- ✅ Files can be successfully restored\n- ✅ Restored files have correct content\n- ✅ Multiple files can be restored at once\n- ✅ Search and filter functions work\n\n### **User Experience Success**\n- ✅ Intuitive workflow (scan → delete → restore)\n- ✅ Clear visual feedback (progress, success messages)\n- ✅ Helpful error messages for edge cases\n- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts work (Ctrl+Z)\n- ✅ Responsive UI during operations\n\n### **Technical Success**\n- ✅ No memory leaks during restore operations\n- ✅ Proper error handling for all edge cases\n- ✅ Consistent logging for debugging\n- ✅ Thread-safe operation registration\n- ✅ Efficient backup storage management\n\n---\n\n## 🎉 **Conclusion**\n\nThe restore functionality has been **completely fixed** by ensuring FileManager properly registers operations with SafetyManager.
