# Row Selection and Restore Dialog Fixes ✅

## Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

Successfully implemented fixes for row selection visual feedback and restore dialog refresh issues.

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Row Selection Visual Feedback ✅
- **Problem**: When a row was selected, not all columns had consistent background color and text was not always visible
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `ThumbnailDelegate::paint()` to handle ALL columns, not just column 0
  - Applied the delegate to all columns using `setItemDelegate()` instead of `setItemDelegateForColumn(0)`
  - Enhanced selection background with theme-aware accent color
  - **Forced white text color on selected rows** for maximum visibility
  - Added proper text alignment (right-align for size column)
- **Result**: Selected rows now have consistent highlighting across all columns with white text

### 2. Restore Dialog Refresh ✅
- **Problem**: After files were restored, they remained visible in the "Restore Files" dialog table
- **Solution**:
  - Modified restore operations to use `QTimer::singleShot()` for delayed refresh
  - Removed duplicate success messages (let main window handle them)
  - Added proper refresh mechanism after restore completion
  - Added `m_restoringFiles` member to track files being restored
- **Result**: Restore dialog now properly refreshes and removes restored files from the table

## Technical Implementation:

### Row Selection Fix:
```cpp
// Enhanced paint method in ThumbnailDelegate
if (opt.state & QStyle::State_Selected) {
    ThemeData currentTheme = ThemeManager::instance()->getCurrentThemeData();
    QColor highlightColor = currentTheme.colors.accent;
    highlightColor.setAlpha(200);
    painter->fillRect(opt.rect, highlightColor);
}

// Force white text on selected rows
if (opt.state & QStyle::State_Selected) {
    textColor = Qt::white;
}
```

### Restore Dialog Fix:
```cpp
// Delayed refresh after restore
QTimer::singleShot(500, this, [this]() {
    loadBackups();
});
```

## Files Modified:
- `src/gui/thumbnail_delegate.cpp` - Enhanced paint method for all columns
- `src/gui/results_window.cpp` - Applied delegate to all columns
- `src/gui/restore_dialog.cpp` - Added delayed refresh mechanism
- `include/restore_dialog.h` - Added tracking member variable

## Verification:
- Application builds successfully
- Row selection now shows consistent highlighting with white text
- Restore dialog properly refreshes after restore operations
- All functionality tested and working
