## Documentation in docs/ Directory

All documentation files in the `docs/` directory were kept as they are reference materials:
- API documentation (API_DESIGN.md, API_FILESCANNER.md, API_RESULTSWINDOW.md)
- Architecture documentation (ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md)
- Development guides (DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md, DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md)
- Build system reference (BUILD_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md)
- FileScanner documentation (FILESCANNER_*.md)
- Implementation planning (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md)
- Testing documentation (TESTING_STATUS.md)
- UI design (UI_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md, UI_WIRING_AUDIT.md)
- Product requirements (PRD.md)
- User guide (USER_GUIDE.md)

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Quick Action Buttons Not Working
**Root Cause:** Signal/slot connections attempted before component pointers were set  
**Solution:** Moved connections to set*() methods in MainWindow  
**Files:** QUICK_ACTIONS_DEBUG.md, SIGNAL_SLOT_WIRING_FIX.md

### 2. Start Scan Button Not Working
**Root Cause:** Signal/slot signature mismatch - signal had parameter, slot didn't  
**Solution:** Updated handleScanConfiguration() to accept ScanConfiguration parameter  
**Files:** SCAN_START_FIX_COMPLETE.md

### 3. Scan Progress Not Showing
**Root Cause:** Multiple issues with signal/slot wiring and component initialization  
**Solution:** Comprehensive wiring fixes and proper component setup  
**Files:** SCAN_NOT_WORKING_DEBUG.md, SCAN_PROGRESS_TEST.md

## IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md Status

The IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md file is up-to-date with:
- ✅ P0 tasks complete (T1, T2, T3)
- ✅ P1 tasks complete (T4, T5, T6, T10)
- ✅ P2 tasks complete (T7, T8, T9)
- ✅ P3 task complete (T20)
- ✅ P4 critical fixes complete (Critical-1, Critical-2, PRD-Verification)
- Overall completion: 75%

No additional tasks needed to be added from the debug files as all issues were resolved and documented.
