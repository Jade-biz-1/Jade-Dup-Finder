   - Defines signals for calculation lifecycle events

2. **src/gui/scan_scope_preview_widget.cpp**
   - Implementation of the scope preview widget
   - Folder counting logic with depth limits
   - File count estimation with sampling for large directories
   - Pattern matching for exclude patterns
   - Debounced updates (500ms delay) to avoid excessive calculations

3. **tests/unit/test_scan_scope_preview_widget.cpp**
   - Comprehensive unit tests using Qt Test framework
   - 16 test cases covering all functionality
   - Tests for debouncing, pattern matching, depth limits, etc.

### Files Modified

1. **include/scan_dialog.h**
   - Added forward declaration for `ScanScopePreviewWidget`
   - Added member variable `m_scopePreviewWidget`
   - Added `updateScopePreview()` method declaration

2. **src/gui/scan_dialog.cpp**
   - Added include for `scan_scope_preview_widget.h`
   - Initialized `m_scopePreviewWidget` in constructor
   - Created widget instance in `createPreviewPanel()`
   - Added `updateScopePreview()` method implementation
   - Connected scope preview updates to configuration changes
   - Integrated with `onOptionsChanged()`, `onDirectoryItemChanged()`, and `onExcludeFolderItemChanged()`

3. **CMakeLists.txt**
   - Added `src/gui/scan_scope_preview_widget.cpp` to GUI_SOURCES
   - Added `include/scan_scope_preview_widget.h` to HEADER_FILES

4. **tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Added test executable configuration for `test_scan_scope_preview_widget`
   - Configured test properties with 60-second timeout
   - Added appropriate labels: "unit;scan;scope;preview;widget;ui"

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Real-time folder counting
- ✅ Estimated file count calculation
- ✅ Estimated size calculation
- ✅ Display of included/excluded paths
- ✅ Debounced updates (500ms delay)
- ✅ Support for exclude patterns
- ✅ Support for exclude folders
- ✅ Maximum depth limit support
- ✅ Hidden file inclusion toggle

### UI Components
- ✅ Folder count label
- ✅ Estimated file count label
- ✅ Estimated size label (formatted: KB, MB, GB, TB)
- ✅ Status label for calculation state
- ✅ Tree widget showing included/excluded paths with status icons
- ✅ Styled widgets matching application theme

### Calculation Logic
- ✅ Efficient directory traversal using `QDirIterator`
- ✅ Sampling for large directories (max 1000 files)
- ✅ Estimation multiplier (1.5x) when sample limit reached
- ✅ Pattern matching using wildcard conversion to regex
- ✅ Path exclusion checking
- ✅ Depth limit enforcement

### Signals
- ✅ `previewUpdated(ScopeStats)` - Emitted when calculation completes
- ✅ `calculationStarted()` - Emitted when calculation begins
- ✅ `calculationFinished()` - Emitted when calculation ends

## Test Results

All 18 unit tests passed successfully:

```

PASS   : ScanScopePreviewWidgetTest::testDebouncedUpdates()
PASS   : ScanScopePreviewWidgetTest::testSignalEmission()
PASS   : ScanScopePreviewWidgetTest::testClearFunction()
PASS   : ScanScopePreviewWidgetTest::testSizeEstimation()
PASS   : ScanScopePreviewWidgetTest::testPatternMatching()
PASS   : ScanScopePreviewWidgetTest::testUpdateAfterClear()

Totals: 18 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 blacklisted, 12240ms
```

## Integration

The widget is fully integrated into the `ScanSetupDialog`:
- Appears in the preview panel on the right side
- Updates automatically when:
  - Target paths are added/removed
  - Exclude patterns are modified
  - Exclude folders are changed
  - Options are changed (depth, hidden files, etc.)
- Uses debouncing to prevent excessive calculations during rapid changes

## Performance Considerations

1. **Debouncing**: 500ms delay prevents excessive calculations during rapid configuration changes
2. **Sampling**: Limits file counting to 1000 files per scan, then estimates the rest
3. **Efficient Traversal**: Uses `QDirIterator` with appropriate filters
4. **Background Processing**: Calculations run on the main thread but are quick due to sampling

## Requirements Verification

Requirement 1.7 from requirements.md:
> WHEN user changes scan scope THEN system SHALL show a preview of what will be scanned (folder count, estimated file count)

✅ **Fully Implemented**:
- Shows folder count
- Shows estimated file count
- Shows estimated size
- Shows included/excluded paths
- Updates on configuration changes
- Uses debounced updates

## Code Quality

- ✅ Follows Qt coding conventions
- ✅ Proper memory management using Qt parent-child ownership
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Logging integration for debugging
- ✅ Well-documented code with clear method names
- ✅ Consistent styling with existing codebase

## Build Status

- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ All tests compile and pass
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ⚠️ Minor compiler warnings (type conversions) - acceptable and consistent with codebase

## Next Steps

Task 6 is complete. The next task in the implementation plan is:

**Task 7: Implement Scan Progress Tracking**
- Add detailed progress tracking to FileScanner
- Implement files-per-second calculation
- Add current folder/file tracking
- Emit detailed progress signals
- Add elapsed time tracking

## Notes

- The widget uses a conservative estimation factor (1.5x) when sampling large directories
- Pattern matching supports wildcards (* and ?) converted to regex
- The UI updates are debounced to provide smooth user experience
- All paths are validated and marked with appropriate status icons
- The implementation is ready for production use
