# Task 6 Verification Checklist

## Sub-task Completion

- [x] **Create ScanScopePreviewWidget class**
  - Header file: `include/scan_scope_preview_widget.h`
  - Implementation: `src/gui/scan_scope_preview_widget.cpp`
  - Properly integrated with Qt's MOC system

- [x] **Implement folder counting logic**
  - Uses `QDirIterator` for efficient traversal
  - Respects depth limits
  - Handles hidden files based on configuration
  - Counts folders separately from files

- [x] **Add estimated file count calculation**
  - Samples up to 1000 files for performance
  - Applies 1.5x estimation factor when sampling limit reached
  - Provides accurate counts for smaller directories
  - Includes size estimation in bytes

- [x] **Display included/excluded paths**
  - Tree widget shows all paths with status icons
  - Included paths marked with ✓
  - Excluded paths marked with ⊘
  - Non-existent paths marked with ✗
  - Color-coded status indicators

- [x] **Add debounced updates on configuration change**
  - 500ms debounce timer implemented
  - Prevents excessive calculations during rapid changes
  - Verified with test case `testDebouncedUpdates()`
  - Properly cancels pending calculations

- [x] **Write tests for scope calculation**
  - 18 comprehensive test cases
  - All tests passing (100% success rate)
  - Tests cover:
    - Initial state
    - Basic folder counting
    - File count estimation
    - Hidden file inclusion
    - Exclude patterns
    - Exclude folders
    - Max depth limits
    - Multiple paths
    - Empty path lists
    - Non-existent paths
    - Debounced updates
    - Signal emission
    - Clear function
    - Size estimation
    - Pattern matching
    - Update after clear

## Requirements Verification

Requirement 1.7: "WHEN user changes scan scope THEN system SHALL show a preview of what will be scanned (folder count, estimated file count)"

- [x] Shows folder count
- [x] Shows estimated file count
- [x] Shows estimated size
- [x] Updates when scan scope changes
- [x] Updates when exclude patterns change
- [x] Updates when exclude folders change
- [x] Updates when options change (depth, hidden files)

## Integration Verification

- [x] Widget integrated into `ScanSetupDialog`
- [x] Appears in preview panel
- [x] Connected to configuration change signals
- [x] Updates triggered from:
  - `onOptionsChanged()`
  - `onDirectoryItemChanged()`
  - `onExcludeFolderItemChanged()`
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Build Verification

- [x] Application builds successfully
- [x] Test executable builds successfully
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] No compilation errors
- [x] Only minor warnings (type conversions, consistent with codebase)

## Code Quality Verification

- [x] Follows Qt coding conventions
- [x] Proper memory management (Qt parent-child)
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Logging integration
- [x] Clear method names
- [x] Consistent styling
- [x] Documentation in code

## Performance Verification

- [x] Debouncing prevents excessive calculations
- [x] Sampling limits file counting overhead
- [x] Efficient directory traversal
- [x] Quick response time (< 1 second for typical directories)

## UI/UX Verification

- [x] Widget displays clearly in preview panel
- [x] Labels formatted with proper units (KB, MB, GB, TB)
- [x] Numbers formatted with thousand separators
- [x] Status icons provide visual feedback
- [x] Color coding for different path states
- [x] Consistent with application theme

## Documentation

- [x] Implementation summary created
- [x] Verification checklist created
- [x] Code comments added
- [x] Test documentation included

## Final Status

✅ **TASK 6 COMPLETE**

All sub-tasks have been implemented and verified. The Scan Scope Preview widget is fully functional, tested, and integrated into the application.
