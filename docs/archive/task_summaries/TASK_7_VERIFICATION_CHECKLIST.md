## Manual Verification Steps

To manually verify the implementation:

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cd build
   cmake --build . --target test_scan_progress_tracking
   ```

2. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   ./tests/test_scan_progress_tracking
   ```

3. **Verify signal emission** (in a test application):
   ```cpp
   FileScanner scanner;
   QObject::connect(&scanner, &FileScanner::detailedProgress,
                    [](const FileScanner::ScanProgress& progress) {
       qDebug() << "Files:" << progress.filesScanned
                << "Rate:" << progress.filesPerSecond << "files/sec"
                << "Elapsed:" << progress.elapsedTimeMs << "ms"
                << "Folder:" << progress.currentFolder;
   });
   
   FileScanner::ScanOptions options;
   options.targetPaths = QStringList() << "/path/to/scan";
   options.progressBatchSize = 100;
   scanner.startScan(options);
   ```

4. **Verify progress data accuracy**:
   - Files scanned count should match actual files processed
   - Bytes scanned should match sum of file sizes
   - Files per second should be reasonable (typically 100-10000 files/sec)
   - Elapsed time should increase monotonically
   - Current folder should reflect the directory being scanned
   - Current file should reflect the file being processed

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Resolved Issues
1. **Test timing issue**: Initial test failure on very fast systems where elapsed time was 0ms at first progress emission. Resolved by adjusting test to check `>= 0` instead of `> 0`.

### Current Limitations
1. **Progress batch size**: Progress is only emitted every N files (default 100). For very small scans (< 100 files), progress might not be emitted at all.
   - **Mitigation**: Users can configure `progressBatchSize` to a smaller value for small scans.

2. **Timer resolution**: `QElapsedTimer` has millisecond resolution. For very fast scans, elapsed time might be 0ms at early progress emissions.
   - **Impact**: Minimal - files-per-second calculation handles this gracefully by checking for division by zero.

3. **Current file tracking**: The current file is updated for every file processed, but only emitted with progress signals (every N files).
   - **Impact**: UI will see the current file at the time of progress emission, not necessarily the file being processed at that exact moment.

## Recommendations for Task 8

When implementing the Scan Progress Dialog (Task 8):

1. **Connect to detailedProgress signal**: Use Qt's signal/slot mechanism to receive progress updates.

2. **Calculate ETA**: Use `elapsedTimeMs` and `filesScanned` to estimate time remaining:
   ```cpp
   if (progress.filesPerSecond > 0 && totalFiles > 0) {
       int remainingFiles = totalFiles - progress.filesScanned;
       int etaSeconds = remainingFiles / progress.filesPerSecond;
   }
   ```

3. **Handle zero elapsed time**: Check for `elapsedTimeMs > 0` before calculating ETA to avoid division by zero.

4. **Format display strings**: Use appropriate units for time (seconds, minutes, hours) and data size (KB, MB, GB).

5. **Update frequency**: The dialog should update whenever the `detailedProgress` signal is emitted (every `progressBatchSize` files).
